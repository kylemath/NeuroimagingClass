## **PART 5: COURSE CONTENT - HISTORY OF NEUROIMAGING (60 minutes)**

### **The Big Picture (15 minutes)**
- **Central question:** How do we measure the invisible - thoughts, emotions, consciousness?
- **Timeline overview:** 200 years of brain measurement evolution
- **Why history matters:** Understanding limitations drives innovation

### **Historical Timeline Deep Dive (35 minutes)**

#### **Pre-Scientific Era → Phrenology (1800s)**
- **Skull bumps theory:** Franz Joseph Gall
- **Why it failed:** No real brain measurement
- **What it got right:** Different brain regions, different functions

#### **Electrical Discovery → EEG (1920s-1950s)**
- **Hans Berger's breakthrough:** First human EEG recordings
- **Alpha waves discovery:** 8-12 Hz rhythm when eyes closed
- **Clinical applications:** Epilepsy detection, sleep studies
- **Limitations:** Poor spatial resolution, surface signals only

#### **Structural Imaging → CT & MRI (1970s-1980s)**
- **CT scans:** X-ray slices, first brain structure images
- **MRI revolution:** Magnetic fields, incredible detail
- **Game changer:** See brain structure in living humans
- **Limitation:** Structure only, not function

#### **Functional Revolution → fMRI (1990s-2000s)**
- **BOLD signal discovery:** Blood oxygen level dependent
- **Spatial + temporal:** Where AND when brain activates
- **Cognitive neuroscience boom:** Map thinking in real-time
- **Current limitations:** Indirect measure, expensive, immobile

#### **Modern Techniques → fNIRS, Advanced EEG, Stimulation (2000s-present)**
- **fNIRS:** Portable functional imaging, natural environments
- **High-density EEG:** Better spatial resolution, source localization
- **Neurostimulation:** TMS, tDCS - not just measure, but modify
- **Brain-computer interfaces:** Direct neural control of devices
