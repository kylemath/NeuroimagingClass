        <h2>Course Prerequisites</h2>
        <p>PSYCH 213 or STAT 151 or 161 and a 300-level psychology course. [Faculty of Science]. It is the responsibility of the student to ensure they have the appropriate prerequisite(s) for the course.</p>
        
        <h2>Course Fees</h2>
        <p>There are no additional course fees beyond standard tuition for this course.</p>

        <h2>Final Grade Calculation Process</h2>
        <p>Term marks will be calculated as follows: Midterm exams (40% total - 20% each), Lab participation and reports (30%), and Final project (30%). The total percentage will be converted to letter grades using the grade distribution table above.</p>
        
        <h2>Access to Past Evaluative Material</h2>
        <p> Sample questions and project examples will be discussed in class prior to each assessment.</p>

        <h2>Attendance</h2>
        <p>Attendance for lab sessions and data collection is expected due to the hands-on nature of the course. Lecture attendance is encouraged but not mandatory. If you feel unwell, please do not feel obligated to be present. Please refer to the Calendar policies on Attendance.</p>

        <h2>Missed Term Work Due to Non-medical Protected Grounds</h2>
        <p>When a term assessment presents a conflict based on non-medical protected grounds (e.g., religious beliefs), students can register with the Academic Success Centre for accommodations via their <a href="https://www.ualberta.ca/current-students/academic-success-centre/accessibility-resources/register/index.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Register for Accommodations website</a>. Students can review their eligibility and choose the registration process specific for Accommodations Based on Non-medical Protected Grounds.</p>
        
        <p>It is imperative that students review the dates of all course assessments upon receipt of the course syllabus, and register AS SOON AS POSSIBLE to ensure the timely application of the accommodation. Students who register later in the term may experience unavoidable delays in the processing of the application, which can affect the accommodation.</p>

        <h2>Missed Term Work Due to Other Reasons</h2>
        <p>A student who cannot complete a term assessment due to incapacitating illness, severe domestic affliction, or other compelling reasons must contact the instructor within two working days of missing the assessment, or as soon as possible, to request an excused absence. If an excused absence is granted, alternative arrangements will be made in consultation with the instructor.</p>
        
        <p>An excused absence is a privilege and not a right. There is no guarantee that an absence will be excused. Misrepresentation of facts to gain an excused absence is a serious breach of the Student Academic Integrity Policy. In all cases, instructors may request adequate documentation to substantiate the reason for the absence, at their discretion.</p>

        <h2>Academic Integrity and Student Conduct</h2>
        <p>The University of Alberta is committed to the highest standards of academic integrity and honesty, as well as maintaining a learning environment that fosters the safety, security, and inherent dignity of each member of the community, ensuring students conduct themselves accordingly. Students are expected to be familiar with the standards of academic honesty and appropriate student conduct, and to uphold the policies of the University in this respect.</p>
        
        <p>Students are particularly urged to familiarize themselves with the provisions of the <a href="https://www.ualberta.ca/governance/resources/policies-standards-and-codes-of-conduct/code-of-student-behaviour/student-academic-integrity-policy.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Student Academic Integrity Policy</a> and the <a href="https://www.ualberta.ca/governance/resources/policies-standards-and-codes-of-conduct/code-of-student-behaviour.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Student Conduct Policy</a>, and avoid any behaviour that could potentially result in suspicions of academic misconduct (e.g., cheating, plagiarism, misrepresentation of facts, participation in an offence) and non-academic misconduct (e.g., discrimination, harassment, physical assault). Academic and non-academic misconduct are taken very seriously and can result in suspension or expulsion from the University.</p>
        
        <p>All students are expected to consult the <a href="https://www.ualberta.ca/current-students/academic-success-centre/academic-integrity/index.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Academic Integrity website</a> for clarification on the various academic offences. All forms of academic dishonesty are unacceptable at the University. Unfamiliarity of the rules, procrastination or personal pressures are not acceptable excuses for committing an offence. Listen to your instructor, be a good person, ask for help when you need it, and do your own work -- this will lead you toward a path to success. Any academic integrity concern in this course will be reported to the College.</p>
        
        <p>Suspected cases of non-academic misconduct will be reported to the <a href="https://www.ualberta.ca/current-students/student-success-and-experience/index.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Office of Student Success and Experience</a>. The College, the Faculty, and the Dean of Students are committed to student rights and responsibilities, and adhere to due process and administrative fairness, as outlined in the Student Academic Integrity Policy and the Student Conduct Policy. Please refer to the policy websites for details on inappropriate behaviours and possible sanctions.</p>
        
        <p>The College of Natural and Applied Sciences (CNAS) has created an <a href="https://sites.google.com/ualberta.ca/cnasacademicintegrity/home" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Academic Integrity for CNAS Students website</a>. To access this website, students must be signed in to their UAlberta account. Website content includes the importance of academic integrity, examples of academic misconduct & possible sanctions, and the academic misconduct & appeal process. Students can also access this material as an online, self-directed Canvas course and complete assessments to test their knowledge.</p>

        <h2>Exam Conduct</h2>
        <p>Please refer to the <a href="https://calendar.ualberta.ca/content.php?catoid=39&navoid=12275#examinations" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Examinations section</a> of the Academic Calendar for more details on Conduct of Exams.</p>
        
        <p>Some key points to be aware of:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>Your student photo ID is required at exams to verify your identity.</li>
          <li>Students must arrive at the specified time to take the exam. Once the exam has started, students must remain in the physical environment for at least 30 minutes.</li>
          <li>All cell phones must be turned off and stored in your bags.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Recording and/or Distribution of Course Materials</h2>
        <p>Audio or video recording, digital or otherwise, of lectures, labs, seminars or any other teaching environment by students is allowed only with the prior written consent of the instructor or as a part of an approved accommodation plan. Student or instructor content, digital or otherwise, created and/or used within the context of the course is to be used solely for personal study, and is not to be used or distributed for any other purpose without prior written consent from the content authors.</p>

        <h2>University Policies</h2>
        <p>Policy about course outlines can be found in Course Requirements, Evaluation Procedures and Grading of the University Calendar.</p>
        
        <p>Nothing in any course outline, syllabus or course website can override or contravene any Calendar regulation or University policy. In resolving any discrepancy, University policy and Calendar regulations take precedence.</p>

Accommodations are coordinated through the Academic Success Centre, and students can learn more about eligibility on the <a href="https://www.ualberta.ca/current-students/academic-success-centre/accessibility-resources/register/index.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Register for Accommodations website</a>.</p>
        
        <p>It is recommended that students apply AS SOON AS POSSIBLE in order to ensure sufficient time to complete accommodation registration and coordination. Students are advised to review and adhere to published deadlines for accommodation approval and for specific accommodation requests (e.g., exam registration submission deadlines). Students who request accommodations less than a month in advance of the academic term for which they require accommodations may experience unavoidable delays or consequences in their academic programs, and may need to consider alternative academic schedules.</p>
