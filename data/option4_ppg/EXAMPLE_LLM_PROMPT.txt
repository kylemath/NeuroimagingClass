OPTION 4: EXAMPLE PROMPT FOR AI ASSISTANT
===============================================

Copy this entire prompt and paste it into ChatGPT, Claude, or another 
AI assistant. Then attach or paste in your PPG data files.

===============================================

I'm working on a blood oxygen saturation (SpO2) estimation project from raw photoplethysmography (PPG) data. I have CSV files with PPG signals recorded at 64 Hz from a Muse S headset with three channels: red wavelength (~660nm), infrared wavelength (~880nm), and ambient light.

The CSV files have this format:
timestamp,ppg_red,ppg_infrared,ppg_ambient
0.000000,924.56,865.23,14.21
0.015625,925.12,866.01,14.18
...

I need you to help me:

1. Write Python code to load and visualize the raw PPG data
2. Apply bandpass filtering (0.5-5 Hz) to isolate the cardiac pulsations
3. Detect cardiac cycles using peak detection
4. For each cardiac cycle, calculate:
   - AC component (pulsatile amplitude) for red and IR channels
   - DC component (baseline level) for red and IR channels
5. Calculate the R-ratio: R = (AC_red / DC_red) / (AC_ir / DC_ir)
6. Estimate SpO2 using the empirical formula: SpO2 ≈ 110 - 25 × R
7. Compare my estimates to the reference SpO2 values from a commercial pulse oximeter

Here are the reference values for validation:
- ppg_baseline_rest_spo2_98.csv: Reference SpO2 = 98%, HR = 68 bpm
- ppg_baseline_rest_spo2_99.csv: Reference SpO2 = 99%, HR = 72 bpm  
- ppg_breath_hold_protocol.csv: Baseline 98%, drops to 94-95% during breath hold (30-60 sec), recovers to 98%
- ppg_post_exercise_spo2_99.csv: Reference SpO2 = 99%, HR = 95 bpm

Please provide:
- Complete Python code with comments
- Visualization plots showing: raw signals, filtered signals, detected peaks, R-ratio over time, estimated SpO2
- Statistical comparison between my estimates and reference values
- Discussion of accuracy and potential sources of error

Use libraries: numpy, scipy, matplotlib, pandas
