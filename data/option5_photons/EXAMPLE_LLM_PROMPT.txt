OPTION 5: EXAMPLE PROMPT FOR AI ASSISTANT
===============================================

Copy this entire prompt and paste it into ChatGPT, Claude, or another 
AI assistant. Then attach or paste in your photon count data files.

===============================================

I'm analyzing an experimental dataset on ultra-weak photon emission from the forehead during different mental states. This is exploratory research testing whether mental effort correlates with measurable changes in photon detection.

The experiment was conducted in complete darkness using an ultra-sensitive photomultiplier tube positioned 5 cm from the subject's forehead. Data was collected at 10 Hz (photon counts per 100ms time bin) for 5 minutes per condition.

CSV files have this format:
timestamp,photon_count,condition
0.000,48,mental_math
0.100,42,mental_math
0.200,51,mental_math
...

Experimental Conditions:
1. photons_control_no_person.csv - Pure background (detector alone, no person)
2. photons_baseline_eyes_open.csv - Subject present, relaxed, eyes open
3. photons_baseline_eyes_closed.csv - Subject present, relaxed, eyes closed
4. photons_mental_math.csv - Intense mental arithmetic (counting backwards)
5. photons_visualization.csv - Complex visual imagery task
6. photons_meditation.csv - Focused attention meditation (low effort)
7. photons_mental_math_session2.csv - Replication of mental math

I need you to help me:

1. Load and visualize the data:
   - Plot photon counts over time for each condition
   - Calculate mean, standard error for each condition
   - Create comparison bar plots

2. Statistical analysis:
   - Compare each condition to the control (no person) baseline using t-tests
   - Use bootstrap or permutation tests for robust p-values
   - Apply multiple comparison correction (Bonferroni or FDR)
   - Calculate effect sizes (Cohen's d or percent change from baseline)

3. Time series analysis:
   - Average counts in 30-second windows
   - Test whether effects persist throughout the 5-minute recording
   - Check for time-dependent trends (temperature drift?)

4. Critical controls:
   - Fit linear trend to control_no_person data (temperature drift)
   - Subtract drift from all other conditions
   - Re-analyze after drift correction

5. Replication test:
   - Compare the two mental math sessions statistically
   - Is the effect replicable?

6. Create publication-quality figures showing:
   - Raw time series for each condition
   - Mean ± SEM comparison across conditions
   - Statistical significance annotations
   - Effect size visualization

7. Provide a critical discussion addressing:
   - Are the effects statistically significant after multiple comparison correction?
   - Can we rule out temperature drift as an explanation?
   - Can we rule out movement artifacts?
   - Is the effect size physiologically plausible?
   - What additional controls would strengthen the conclusions?

Important: Photon counting follows Poisson statistics (variance = mean). Use appropriate statistical tests.

Please provide complete Python code with detailed comments, all figures, and statistical results tables.

Use libraries: numpy, scipy, matplotlib, pandas, seaborn

TIPS FOR USING THIS PROMPT:
===============================================

✓ Copy everything above this line
✓ Paste into your AI assistant (ChatGPT, Claude, etc.)
✓ Attach ALL 7 .csv files from the data/option5_photons/ folder
✓ The AI will generate complete analysis code for you!

For your report:
- Include all generated figures
- Present the statistical test results in a table
- Write a critical discussion section addressing alternative explanations:
  * Temperature drift over the 2-hour session?
  * Movement artifacts during mental tasks?
  * Statistical noise (Type I error)?
  * Light leaks into the dark room?
  * Order effects (later recordings ≠ mental effort)?

- Conclude with:
  * What additional experiments would test your conclusion?
  * What are the limitations of this dataset?
  * Is the effect size consistent with published biophoton emission literature?

Remember: The goal is rigorous experimental design and skeptical analysis, 
not proving a controversial claim! Be critical. Consider all alternative 
explanations. Design better controls for future experiments.

Good luck! 🔬
