PSYCH 403A1 - Option 5: Mental Effort & Photon Emission  
========================================================
Experimental Protocol and Data Collection Report

⚠️ IMPORTANT NOTE: This is a speculative / exploratory experiment investigating 
an unproven phenomenon. The goal is to teach rigorous experimental design, 
proper controls, and critical statistical analysis — not to prove that 
"ultra-weak photon emission from the brain" is real. Students should approach 
this data with healthy skepticism and consider ALL alternative explanations!

SUBJECT: Kyle Mathewson (Instructor)
DATE: December 4-5, 2025 (evening sessions)
LOCATION: Optical Imaging Laboratory (B-22), Biological Sciences Building
DEVICE: Hamamatsu H10722-110 Photon Counting Module (ultra-sensitive PMT)
DARK ROOM: Light-sealed chamber, complete darkness verified with IR camera

===========================================
EXPERIMENTAL RATIONALE
===========================================

Some controversial studies have claimed that neural activity might correlate 
with ultra-weak biophoton emission detectable at the skin surface. The proposed 
mechanisms include:
- Oxidative stress producing chemiluminescence
- Lipid peroxidation during intense neural activity
- Quantum effects in microtubules (highly speculative!)

This experiment tests whether mental effort (mental arithmetic, visualization) 
produces a measurable change in photon detection at the forehead compared to 
relaxed baseline states.

🔬 Critical Experimental Design Principle:
The experiment is designed with PROPER CONTROLS to test alternative explanations:
- Temperature changes from blood flow?
- Movement artifacts?  
- Light leaks into the dark room?
- Pure chance / statistical noise?

===========================================
APPARATUS SETUP
===========================================

Photon Detection System:
- Device: Hamamatsu H10722-110 photon counting module
- Quantum Efficiency: ~10% at 500-600nm (peak sensitivity)
- Dark Count Rate: ~35-50 counts/second at room temperature
- Detection Area: 8mm diameter active area
- Temperature: Passively cooled (not chilled, room temp ~22°C)

Positioning:
- Detector placed 5 cm from subject's forehead (frontal cortex region)
- Fixed mount to prevent movement artifacts
- Black fabric hood to eliminate external light
- Subject's eyes either open or closed (varied by condition)

Dark Room Environment:
- Light-sealed chamber with blackout curtains
- Verified complete darkness with IR camera (no visible/IR light sources)
- Door sealed with black tape
- Subject allowed 10 min dark adaptation before each session
- Temperature monitored: 21-22°C throughout all recordings

Data Acquisition:
- Photon counts integrated over 100ms time bins (10 Hz sampling)
- Each recording: 5 minutes = 300 seconds = 3000 data points
- Timestamp precision: 1 ms

===========================================
EXPERIMENTAL PROTOCOL
===========================================

All recordings: 5 minutes per condition
Subject Position: Seated, head stabilized with chin rest
Total dark adaptation period: 10 minutes before first recording

Control Conditions (No Mental Task):

Condition: Intense mental arithmetic
Task Instructions: "Count backwards from 1000 by 7. When you reach a number, 
subtract 7 again. Continue for the entire 5 minutes. Stay focused."
Example: 1000 → 993 → 986 → 979 → 972...

room in vivid detail — colors, textures, objects. Rotate objects in your mind. 
Navigate through doorways."
Subject Report: "Required significant mental effort to maintain vivid imagery"
Mean Count Rate: ~43.2 photons/sec (~2.8% increase from control)

then start over. If your mind wanders, gently return to breath counting."
Subject Report: "Relaxed state, low cognitive load"
Mean Count Rate: ~42.2 photons/sec (similar to baseline)
Notes: Low mental effort condition, similar to rest

Recording 7: photons_mental_math_session2.csv
Date: December 5, 2025, 7:45 PM
Condition: Mental arithmetic (replication session)
Task: Count backwards from 500 by 13
Subject Report: "Similar mental effort to first math session"
Mean Count Rate: ~43.3 photons/sec (~3.2% increase from control)
Notes: Replication of mental effort condition

===========================================
DATA STRUCTURE
===========================================

CSV File Format:
timestamp,photon_count,condition
0.000,48,control_no_person
0.100,42,control_no_person  
0.200,39,control_no_person
...

- timestamp: seconds from recording start
- photon_count: integer count of photons detected in 100ms time bin
- condition: text label of experimental condition

===========================================
STATISTICAL CHARACTERISTICS
===========================================

Photon Count Distribution:
- Follows Poisson statistics (expected for photon counting)
- Mean count per 100ms bin: ~4.2 counts
- Equivalent to ~42 photons/second
- Standard deviation: ~2.1 counts (sqrt of mean for Poisson)

Effect Sizes (compared to control_no_person baseline):
- Baseline (eyes open/closed): +0.5-0.8% (negligible)
- Meditation: +0.4% (negligible)  
- Visualization: +2.8% (subtle)
- Mental Math #1: +3.5% (subtle but potentially detectable)
- Mental Math #2: +3.2% (replication)

Statistical Significance:
Given Poisson noise, 3.5% effect with 3000 samples:
- Expected p-value: ~0.02-0.05 (borderline significant with proper analysis)
- Requires careful windowing and averaging to detect
- Bootstrapping or permutation tests recommended

===========================================
ALTERNATIVE EXPLANATIONS TO CONSIDER
===========================================

⚠️ Students MUST address these in their analysis:

1. Temperature Drift:
   - PMT dark current increases ~7% per °C
   - Room temp varied ±0.5°C over 2-hour session
   - Could this explain the effect?

2. Movement Artifacts:
   - Did subject move more during mental tasks?
   - Could vibrations from sub-vocal counting affect detector?

3. Light Leaks:
   - Could mental effort cause changes in body position that let in light?
   - Control recordings show good darkness, but double-check

4. Order Effects:
   - Later recordings have higher counts — pure time effect?
   - Temperature accumulation over session?

5. Statistical Noise:
   - With enough comparisons, some will be "significant" by chance
   - Multiple comparison correction needed?

6. Confirmation Bias:
   - Experimenter (instructor) knows the hypothesis
   - Could this affect which trials are "acceptable"?

===========================================
ANALYSIS GUIDANCE FOR STUDENTS
===========================================

Required Steps:

1. Visualize Raw Data:
   - Plot photon counts over time for each condition
   - Calculate mean and standard error for each condition
   - Compare to control (no person) baseline

2. Statistical Testing:
   - Perform t-tests comparing each condition to control
   - Use bootstrap or permutation tests for robust p-values
   - Correct for multiple comparisons (Bonferroni or FDR)

3. Time Window Analysis:
   - Average counts in 30-second windows
   - Does the effect persist throughout the 5-minute recording?
   - Or is it only at the beginning/end?

4. Control for Temperature Drift:
   - Fit linear trend to control_no_person data
   - Subtract this drift from all other conditions
   - Does the effect remain?

5. Effect Size Estimation:
   - Calculate Cohen's d or percent change from baseline
   - Is the effect physiologically plausible?
   - Compare to published biophoton emission studies

Critical Discussion Points:

✓ Is the effect statistically significant?
✓ Is it replicable? (compare two mental math sessions)
✓ Can we rule out temperature drift?  
✓ Can we rule out movement artifacts?
✓ What additional controls would strengthen the conclusion?
✓ Is the effect size consistent with any known biophysical mechanism?

🎯 The Point: Teach rigorous experimental design and skeptical data analysis!
