OPTION 5: Mental Effort & Photon Emission
==========================================

⚠️ CRITICAL: This explores a controversial/speculative phenomenon!
Your job is rigorous experimental design and skeptical data analysis.

Quick Start Guide
-----------------

📊 Data Files (7 recordings, 5 minutes each):
  Control Conditions:
  • photons_control_no_person.csv - Background (no person present) ⭐ KEY
  • photons_baseline_eyes_open.csv - Relaxed baseline
  • photons_baseline_eyes_closed.csv - Relaxed baseline (eyes closed)
  • photons_meditation.csv - Low mental effort

  Active Mental Task Conditions:
  • photons_mental_math.csv - Intense mental arithmetic
  • photons_visualization.csv - Complex visual imagery
  • photons_mental_math_session2.csv - Replication session

📖 Documentation:
  • EXPERIMENT_PROTOCOL.txt - Full experimental protocol & critical discussion
  • EXAMPLE_LLM_PROMPT.txt - Copy-paste prompt for AI-assisted analysis

🎯 Your Goal:
Test whether mental effort correlates with detectable changes in photon 
emission. CRITICALLY evaluate alternative explanations (temperature drift,
movement artifacts, statistical noise, light leaks).

💡 Analysis Strategy:
  1. Compare all conditions to control_no_person baseline
  2. Calculate mean photon rate per condition (should be ~42-43 Hz)
  3. Effect is SUBTLE (~3% increase) - requires careful statistics!
  4. Use t-tests, bootstrap, permutation tests
  5. Correct for multiple comparisons
  6. Test for temperature drift (linear trend over time)
  7. DISCUSS alternative explanations thoroughly!

🔬 Expected Results:
  - Mental math shows ~3.5% increase (borderline significant)
  - Visualization shows ~2.8% increase  
  - Baseline/meditation show minimal difference from control
  - BUT: Could this be temperature drift? Movement? Statistical noise?

🚀 Getting Started:
  → Read EXPERIMENT_PROTOCOL.txt carefully (includes critical discussion)
  → Use EXAMPLE_LLM_PROMPT.txt to generate analysis code
  → Be skeptical! Consider ALL alternative explanations!
